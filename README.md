 # Motif Mark

Welcome to the Motif Mark assignment repository!

## Overview

Motif Mark is an assignment where we utilize object-oriented programming in Python along with Pycairo to draw genes, their exons, and identify specific motifs within DNA sequences.

## Introduction

In molecular biology, a motif refers to a specific pattern or sequence within a DNA molecule that often has biological significance. Identifying motifs helps researchers understand the structure and function of genes.

## Assignment Objectives

- Implement object-oriented programming principles in Python.
- Utilize Pycairo, a 2D graphics library, to create visual representations of genes and motifs.
- Process DNA sequences from FASTA files.
- Identify and highlight motifs within DNA sequences.

## Features

- **Gene Drawing**: Genes and their exons are visually represented, with exons highlighted in green.
- **Motif Identification**: Specific motifs within DNA sequences are identified and highlighted.
- **Legend**: A legend is provided to interpret the visual representation, indicating the meaning of different colors used for genes, exons, and motifs.

## Handling capabilities

- **Motifs with ambiguous nucleotides**
- **Multiple sequences**
- **Mulitple motifs**

## Dependencies

- **Pycairo**
